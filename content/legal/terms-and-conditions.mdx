WaitQ is owned by [Azor Studio](https://azor.studio)™, a Portuguese trademarked brand.

Support: [joao@azor.studio](mailto\:joao@azor.studio)

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of WaitQ’s software-as-a-service waitlist/queue management platform, including our website(s), dashboards, APIs, and related services (the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to following terms:

### Definitions

* If you use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent you have authority to bind that entity, and “Customer” means that entity.
* “Authorized Users”: Customer’s employees, contractors, or agents permitted to use the Service.
* “Customer Data”: data submitted to the Service by or for Customer, including personal data of End Users.
* “End Users”: Customer’s clients/visitors who join queues/waitlists or receive messages.
* “MoR”: Merchant of Record (the entity that sells to the purchaser and processes payment/taxes).

### Scope and eligibility

The Service is primarily intended for business (B2B) use, but we do not prevent individuals from using it. Where mandatory consumer laws apply, nothing in these Terms limits rights that cannot be waived under applicable law (including rules on digital services conformity/remedies where applicable).

You must be at least 18 (or the age of majority where you live) to create an account.

### Account registration and security

You must provide accurate account information and keep it updated. You are responsible for all activities under your account and for maintaining the confidentiality of credentials.

You must notify us promptly of any suspected unauthorized access or security incident involving your account.

### The Service

WaitQ provides queue/waitlist tooling such as queue creation, visitor capture, staff workflows, notifications (SMS/email), and analytics. Features and limits vary by plan and may change under Section 20.

### Acceptable use

You will not (and will not allow anyone to):

* Use the Service unlawfully or in violation of third-party rights.
* Send messages without valid consent or required disclosures, or ignore opt-outs (see Section 12).
* Upload malware, attempt to bypass security, scrape or probe the Service, or overload it.
* Reverse engineer the Service except to the extent permitted by mandatory law.
* Use the Service to process special-category data (e.g., health, biometrics) unless we agree in writing.

We may suspend or restrict access to protect the Service, other customers, End Users, or the public.

### Customer responsibilities (including End Users)

Customer is responsible for:

* Its business operations, queue policies, and customer service.
* The content of Customer Data and messages it sends through the Service.
* Providing notices and obtaining consents from End Users, including for SMS/email communications (Section 12).
* Ensuring Authorized Users comply with these Terms.

### Plans, trials, and ordering

Plan features, usage limits, and pricing are described on the checkout page, order form, or plan page at the time of purchase.

### Billing, MoR, taxes

Payments are processed by Polar.sh, which may act as the Merchant of Record (MoR) for your purchase, meaning Polar (not Azor Studio) may be the seller of record and may collect and remit applicable VAT/sales taxes for the transaction. You agree that:

Polar’s checkout, tax calculation/collection, invoicing, and payment processing terms may apply to your purchase.

You are still responsible for your own income/revenue taxes related to using/selling with the Service (as applicable).

If there is a conflict between Polar’s payment/refund handling and these Terms, Polar’s MoR requirements may control for the transaction processing aspects.

### Renewals, cancellation, and price changes

Subscriptions renew automatically unless you cancel before the renewal date. Cancellation generally takes effect at the end of the current billing period unless otherwise stated at checkout.

We may change prices or plan structures prospectively with reasonable notice; changes apply at renewal (or as described in the notice).

### Refunds and chargebacks

Refund handling may be constrained by Polar’s MoR policies and chargeback prevention practices. Polar reserves the right to issue refunds within 60 days of purchase at its discretion to prevent chargebacks.

Unless required by law or stated otherwise at checkout/order form, fees are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds for partial periods.

### Third-party services and integrations (BulkGate, Resend, etc.)

The Service may rely on third-party services (including SMS delivery providers such as BulkGate and email delivery providers such as Resend). Those services are provided under their own terms and may have independent outages, limitations, and compliance requirements.

We are not responsible for third-party services’ acts/omissions, deliverability issues, carrier filtering, or third-party policy enforcement.

### Messaging (SMS/email) compliance

Customer is the “sender” (or causes sending) of communications to End Users and is responsible for lawful messaging, including obtaining appropriate consent and honoring opt-outs. BulkGate’s guidance highlights that the sender is responsible for collecting and processing opt-ins and opt-outs and providing “HELP” information flows where relevant.

You must not use the Service to send unsolicited messages. For email deliverability and compliance, sending without consent can lead to blocking/filtering and provider enforcement actions (including suspension).

We may suspend messaging functionality or accounts if we reasonably believe you are violating consent/opt-out rules, causing high complaint rates, or otherwise threatening our provider reputation or service integrity.

### Intellectual property

We (or our licensors) own the Service and all related IP. We grant Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Service during the subscription term for its internal business purposes.

Customer owns Customer Data. Customer grants us a worldwide, non-exclusive license to host, copy, transmit, process, and display Customer Data only to provide, secure, and improve the Service and to comply with law.

### Feedback

If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us the right to use it without restriction or compensation. You can provide feedback by sending an e-mail to [joao@azor.studio](mailto\:joao@azor.studio)

### Confidentiality

Each party may receive Confidential Information from the other. The receiving party will use it only to perform under these Terms and will protect it using reasonable care.

Confidentiality does not apply to information that is public without breach, independently developed, or lawfully obtained from a third party.

### Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data. No method of transmission or storage is fully secure, and you accept the inherent risks of online systems.

### Disclaimers

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation, error-free performance, or that messages will be delivered (delivery can be affected by carriers, spam filters, third-party providers, and End User devices).

### Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

* We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, or data.
* Our total liability for all claims related to the Service is limited to the fees paid by Customer for the Service in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim (or EUR \[X], whichever is greater).
* Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be limited under mandatory law.

### Indemnification

By Customer: Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless WaitQ (Azor Studio) from third-party claims arising from:

* Customer Data or message content,
* Customer’s failure to obtain consent or honor opt-outs,
* Customer’s breach of these Terms,
* Customer’s unlawful or negligent use of the Service.

By WaitQ (optional B2B clause): We will defend and indemnify Customer from third-party claims alleging the Service infringes IP rights, provided Customer promptly notifies us and cooperates. Our obligations may include modifying/replacing affected functionality or terminating and refunding prepaid unused fees.

### Suspension and termination

We may suspend access immediately if we reasonably believe:

* Your use violates these Terms or applicable law,
* Your activity risks harm to the Service, providers (BulkGate/Resend), other customers, or End Users,
* We are required to do so by law.

Either party may terminate for material breach if not cured within 15 days after written notice (except where immediate termination is justified).

### Data export, retention, and deletion

Upon termination, we will provide a reasonable opportunity (e.g., 30 days) for Customer to export Customer Data if technically feasible and if the account is in good standing.

After that period, we will delete or anonymize Customer Data in accordance with our retention policy and legal obligations.

### Changes to the Service or Terms

We may change the Service and update these Terms from time to time. Best practices for updating terms include providing notice and stating an effective date for changes. If changes materially reduce your rights, we will provide reasonable notice (e.g., email or in-app notice) and identify the effective date.

Continuing to use the Service after the effective date means you accept the updated Terms.

### Governing law and jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of Portugal. The courts of Ponta Delgada have jurisdiction, without prejudice to mandatory consumer protection rules where applicable.
