        },
        {
          "question": "What are the benefits of a virtual waitlist software in a physical business?",
          "answer": "A virtual waitlist reduces crowding at your entrance, keeps customers informed with accurate wait times, reduces walk-aways, and frees up your staff from constantly answering \"how much longer?\" questions. It also provides valuable analytics to optimize your operations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do we need to purchase hardware?",
          "answer": "No. WaitQ works on any device with a web browser - tablets, phones, or computers you already own. No special hardware, pagers, or equipment needed."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the expected ROI of WaitQ?",
          "answer": "Most restaurants see ROI within the first month through increased table turnover and reduced walk-aways. With just one additional seated party per day, WaitQ pays for itself."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is billing based on each waitlist?",
          "answer": "No, billing is based on your plan tier. You can create unlimited waitlists within your plan limits."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you offer real-time insights and analytics?",
          "answer": "Yes! WaitQ provides real-time analytics including average wait times, peak hours, customer patterns, and more to help you optimize your operations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is WaitQ easy to set up?",
          "answer": "Yes! WaitQ can be set up in under 5 minutes. Simply create an account, configure your waitlist settings, and you're ready to start managing your queue."
