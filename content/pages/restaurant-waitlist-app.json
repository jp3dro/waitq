    "title": "Frequently asked questions",

      {
        "question": "What is a restaurant waitlist app?",
        "answer": "A restaurant waitlist app is a digital tool that helps you manage walk-in customers. Instead of paper lists, guests check in on a tablet or their phone, track their place in line, and get notified when their table is ready."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does a restaurant need a waitlist app like WaitQ?",
        "answer": "WaitQ reduces front-door chaos, cuts perceived wait times, and frees your team to focus on hospitality instead of queue management. It also provides data to help you optimize staffing and seating."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does WaitQ replace the check-in page?",
        "answer": "Yes! WaitQ provides a customizable check-in page that matches your brand. Guests can join the waitlist via QR code, tablet kiosk, or a link on your website."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I need to add a guest to a waitlist manually?",
        "answer": "No problem. Your host can add guests manually with a name and phone number. The guest will still receive SMS updates and can track their position online."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I have separate waitlists for bar, patio and dining room?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can create multiple waitlists for different areas of your restaurant, each with its own settings and notifications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does WaitQ also work with reservations? What if the guest booked on a third-party website?",
        "answer": "WaitQ focuses on walk-in management. For reservations, you can manually add reserved guests to the queue when they arrive, ensuring they're seated on time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the app on iPhone, iPad or Android?",
        "answer": "Yes! WaitQ works on any device with a web browser—iPhone, iPad, Android phones, tablets, or computers."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is WaitQ easy to install?",
        "answer": "Very easy. There's nothing to install. Just sign up, configure your settings, and you're ready to go in under 5 minutes."
