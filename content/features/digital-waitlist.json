          "question": "What are the benefits of a virtual waitlist software for physical locations?",
          "answer": "Virtual waitlists reduce crowding at your entrance, cut perceived wait times, and free your staff to focus on hospitality. Guests are happier because they can see their position and estimated wait in real time."

          "question": "How do you build a successful virtual waitlist?",

        {
          "question": "What happens if guests step away or don't show up?",
