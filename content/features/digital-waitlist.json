        },
        {
          "question": "What are the benefits of a virtual waitlist software for physical locations?",
          "answer": "Virtual waitlists reduce crowding at your entrance, cut perceived wait times, and free your staff to focus on hospitality. Guests are happier because they can see their position and estimated wait in real time."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you build a successful virtual waitlist?",
          "answer": "Start with clear check-in options (QR code, tablet, or staff entry), send timely SMS updates, and keep estimated wait times accurate. WaitQ handles all of this automatically."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can we accept both walk-ins and online joins to the waitlist?",
          "answer": "Yes! WaitQ supports both. Walk-ins can be added by staff, while online guests can join via a link on your website or social media."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if guests step away or don't show up?",
          "answer": "WaitQ sends reminder notifications. If a guest doesn't respond, you can mark them as arrived, seated, skipped, or no-show, keeping the line moving without losing track of who’s next."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you offer real-time analytics and why is it important?",
          "answer": "Yes! WaitQ provides real-time and historical analytics on wait times, party sizes, and peak hours. This data helps you optimize staffing, predict busy periods, and improve the guest experience."
