## Introducing WaitQ

Waiting is one of the easiest places for a business to lose goodwill—especially when guests feel left in the dark.

WaitQ helps you:

* Keep guests updated with clear status and notifications
* Reduce “Where are we in line?” interruptions
* Improve flow during peak hours

### What’s next

We’ll be sharing short, actionable posts about waitlist operations, messaging best practices, and product updates.
